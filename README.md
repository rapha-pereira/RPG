## Getting Started

This is an IFSC student class project* that creates an RPG game using Java, our currently learning programming language.
It has basic behaviors, but it's experimental since we don't know Java, and it works entirely around objects/classes using OOP basics.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources, the main RPG project
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies, such as Java.classes and etc.
